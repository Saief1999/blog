> Note : All the things mentioned below are different from Tunisia in some way or another. It's a comprehensive list of things that I have never seen before. Have fun reading this list :)

> Note 2 : The notes below are subjective and they reflect my own experience. So take them with a grain of salt.

## The Weather

First and foremost, obviously, it's much colder here than it is in Tunisia. Sky is generally cloudy and even when it's sunny it's not very hot. ( 30° C is considered quite hot here. It's considered just a normal day in Tunisia )

## Traffic

- People respect traffic lights very much here. Even when there's no one in the street
- They have a button to request passing the street ( make the light go green faster). There's also a distinct noise ( for blind people ). ( Note: After a while you become very used to that noise, that you essentially associate it with your right to cross the street... )
- They have traffic lights & lanes for bicycles.
- Buses/cars go on tram tracks. In Tunisia this is just considered breaking the law.
- Everyone bikes in this country ( different ages, different genders ). In Tunisia it is much more rare than this. there's a place to park your bike in every store.

## Services

- There's **free Wifi** In Stores(Lidl, Kaufland, ...) Trains and airports.
- They have mobile subscriptions for free audio calls within Germany and Europe.

## Garbage disposal

- They divide garbage (Cardboards/papers, plastic & aluminium & Tin cans, food and food containers ). And they respect this very much. Households typically have different kinds of bins both inside (small) and outside (big). Weirdly enough, they throw bread with the rest of the food. In Tunisia, bread is generally separated.

## Toilet tools: the pain...

- No water jet for toilets ( This is what a water jet is https://www.sopal.com/uploads/produits/4401B00.jpg ). People use toilet paper much much more than we do. Which is weird for a country that tries to be efficient with everything.

## Trains

- There are announcement boards on the S-Bahn/U-Bahn/Tram/Bus that tell you what the next station will be. They also tell you whether you should exit to the right or left.
- There are announcement boards in the train station that tell you what next train is coming and when
- Trains are *generally* on time (I'm looking at you, DB...)
- You can take your bike on some trains
- If you buy your ticket from the machine, you need to stamp it ( in order to add the time ) Otherwise it is considered not valid. Some ticket come pre-stamped. If you bought online you're all good though
- On regional trains. There are heaters, all seats have a power outlet and they also have two floors ( the one up is for first class )

## Animals

- Almost no stray dogs at all
- People get pets much more than we do in Tunisia. They also seem to be much more trained.
- they have a lot of ducks/Geese and Ravens. We never see ducks outside in Tunisia.

## Houing

- The house I stayed in has double windows ( window, then a small space, then window again ). Why? I have no clue.
- Since many houses are built from wood. Cleaning is different. They don't just drop water on the floor then sweep using a **raclette** like we do ( this is a **raclette** https://i.otto.de/i/otto/57d43f8b-739b-5183-a81d-be9749c35db9?w=616&h=1224 ) . They generally vacuum and sometimes sweep using some water

# Other

- Most Stores don't work on public holidays or on sundays. They are considered rest days where people just go to parks, amusement parks or a café. In tunisia public holidays and weekends are the busiest times for the stores.
- There is a machine to get train tickets which accepts cards and cash. Then when at the station, you need to use another machine on your ticket (to stamp it).
- In Marketplaces they are allowed to take backpacks inside. They sometimes look inside the backpacks ( didn't happen to me personally ).
- In Lidl, Taking bread out is quite annoying. You use a stick to push the bread you want sideways and then take it. Never seen something similar in Tunisia
- Everyone signals right/left with their hand before turning when cycling.
- You can open an EU bank account and shop for stuff online which is very convenient.
- Pirating is illegal. Torrents are tracked however normal internet browsing is generally not tracked ( e.g. Browsing a normal HTTP domain ) . If you get caught pirating you can get a huge fine. They don't do warnings too. a fine straight away.
- In potsdam, they have a lot, a lot, a LOT of parks. 
- They have double decker buses
- Cashiers are very fast!
- When one friend is buying from a coffee shop. You're allowed to sit with him, even if you're not buying anything.
- Some people have baby carriers behind their bikes
- In berlin, they have lots of pigeons. I've spotted a couple of rats too.
- In the road between potsdam <-> Berlin. There Have an underground road only for bikes and people
- They have deer signs, and signs for people riding horses.
- Internet subscriptions are much more expensive than they are in Tunisia ( or other european countries for that matter )
- Their capital is much more dirtier than ours ( Yes, I was suprised too... )
- They seem to have much lower voice tone than us when speaking in public. Even when they're screaming.
- Like we notice europeans easily in Tunisia. We stand out here.
- People don't honk much, at least in Potsdam. They won't use it unless it's absolutely necessary.
- People in shops and big marketplaces seem to be very friendly. Locals might not notice this, but in Tunisia, the cashier won't greet you ( unless he knows you ) and won't wish you a happy day before leaving.
- People in Germany don't greet strangers in the street as much as we do. In Tunisia, greeting people in the street is much more common.
- Germans here, even though they're quite nice, seem quite *colder* than arabs when speaking. Arabs are much more cheerful.
- Everyone seems to be choosing his friend circle very carefully and they generally tend to keep to themselves. Arabs are more open in this regard, we make friends much more easily ( even for introverts )
- Children in Germany are generally very well mannered compared to the ones back home. I think this has to do with their social groups and friends. Not their family in particular.
- Much more fork & knife. Much less spoon and bread. They don't cook as much sauces as we do.
- Coffee is expensive, and not necessarily better
- Their tea is different than ours. Capsules are much more common than us. Our tea is generally home made and is much stronger in flavour.
- They have bio food, and even markets that sell only bio food ( more expensive than regular ). In Tunisia, when you go to the weekly market (where everyone goes shopping for fruits/vegetables each week), everything is organic and even cheaper than supermarkets.
- People in germany love international food. Even imitations that are not quite right sometimes. In Tunisia, we love our cuisine, sometimes we try out other cuisines but it's not very common. We seem to be much more picky with our food.
- They have the "Pfand" system where you pay for the plastic bottle beforehand, but get its price back when your return it.
- People don't generally accept help ( for e.g. when they're holding heavy bags ).
- Pizza Bell in restaurants
- Trains differ from one state to another ( different colors, big/small tables, with/without AC )
- They have "Toast" (Prost) which we don't do. But in addition to that, they have the habit of looking to the person in his eyes while doing the toast. Some germans really care about this.
- A large turkish population exists in germany. So getting Halal meat and products is never an issue.
- Cashiers in supermarkets seem to greet each and every customer. And afterwards they will tell you good bye. Or at the end of the week they will wish you a happy weekend. We don't do that in Tunisia. And we don't generally wish a happy weekend to people. However we do have our own traditions ( calling family/friends during celerations to say "Happy Eid")
- As muslims, before eating we mostly say "besmellah". When we finish we say "Hamdoullah". As tunisians, after showering/eating/sleeping we say "sa7a" to whoever had it to wish them good health. Nothing similar to this exists in Germany.
- Whenever you're eating food near friends. In tunisia you will almost always ask the person in front of you if they want some of what you're having ( In case they crave it ). In Germany this simply doesn't exist.
- Amazon Delivery is much better than delivery we have in Tunisia. You get ETA also and you can even track the delivery Driver ( how many stops until it reaches you
